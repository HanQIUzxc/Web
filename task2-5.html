    <h1>A page with some divs and spans</h1>
    <p>This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.</p>
    <p>Because this div is special, it has its own id, "content".
        This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.</p>
    <p>This is a normal paragraph, except this <span class="blue">span of text is blue</span> and this <span class="fancy">span has a font-family of cursive</span>,
        because they belong to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p>
